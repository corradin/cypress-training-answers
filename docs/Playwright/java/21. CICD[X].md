# Setup Playwright in CICD

# Running in a Pipeline in Github Actions

One of the most powerful ways to run Playwright tests is as part of your CICD (Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery) process. Getting feedback running your tests after the code is integrated but before it ships allows you to guarantee a certain degree of quality of your product.
In this exercise we will see how to run the tests in the pipeline.

The picture below shows a typical setup of a CICD pipeline.

## Exercise: Setup and create Playwright tests in Github Actions

In this exercise we will create a pipeline in Github. You can then translate what you learned here to your own environment.
Github actions follow a certain syntax that can be found [HERE](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

1. Create a `build.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory.
2. You always start your YAML file with the name of your worklfow for example: `name: Build and Playwright`.
3. Next, you define a trigger for when your workflow that contains jobs (more on that later) needs to start.
   You can create it as follows:

```yaml
on: 
  push
```

   This means that whenever new changes are pushed, the workflow will be triggered.

4. Next, you need to create a job. A workflow contains at least one [job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobs).
5. You can create a job as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run my Playwright tests
```

Here we have created a job and gave it a display friendly name. This name will be shown in the UI in Github Actions.

6. We also need to define on what machine the job will run. We will use a widely used value for this:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run my Playwright tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

7. A job will not do much until it has steps defined. Steps run in sequence and are defined with the `steps` keyword. 
   
   Let's define a step:

```yaml
- name: Get the code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

In the above snippet, we name the step with a display friendly name and we use the predefined Github action `actions/checkout@v3`, which gives the command to checkout (also known as `fetch` or `pull`) our code from Github.

8. Now that we have checked out our code, we can continue setting up our environment. Recall from the course prerequisites that you need Java on your system. We need the same to be true for the machine for which this workflow runs. 

We can do this as follows:

```yaml
 - name: Set up JDK 17
   uses: actions/setup-java@v3
   with:
    distribution: 'temurin'
    java-version: '17'
```

Here we tell the machine to install a version of Java that we specify in the `java-version` field. We do this with the `setup-java@v3` action. This action executes all the necessary commands to setup Java.

9.  Before we can run our tests, we need to downloade the browser binaries. We can do that as follows:

```yaml
- name: Install browsers
  run: mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install --with-deps"
```

The `--with-deps` argument allows us to download the dependencies needed to run browsers.

10.    Make sure that the following is true for you test:
       1.     It runs in headless mode.
       2.     It can be run with `mvn test` locally. 
       3.     The test is successful.

11.   Edit the `build.yml` and add the last step as follows:

```yaml
- name: Run Playwright
  run: mvn test
```

12. Save the file, commit and push it to your remote.
13. Go to Github where you forked the repository and examine the `Actions` tab.


## Bonus: generate a trace log

If everything went well you saw a nice green passing build, but didn't have any other information of how this would look on a screen. In this exercise you will generate a trace log so you can see what happened during the build.

1. Recall how you can generate a trace zip file locally and use this knowledge to generate a trace for your CICD test.
2. Test this locally first and when the trace is generated add the following to the end of your build yaml file:
  
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-trace
    path: client/tests/java/trace
```

3. Add an additional command to unzip the trace generated by Playwright
```yaml
 - name: Run Playwright
   working-directory: client/tests/java
   run: | 
    mvn test
    unzip trace.zip -d trace
```

Why do you think this is needed?

4. Push your changes to the remote.

What do you notice? How is your build output different from before?
