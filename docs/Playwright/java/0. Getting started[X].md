# Getting started

## Welcome!

These pages serve as documentation for the Playwright Training. You can work through the exercises at your own pace. Read carefully and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

## Prerequisites

1. You will need to sign in to [codeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/). You can do this using your Github, Google or Apple account. If you have none of those, you would need to create a (preferably) [github account](https://github.com/join).
2. You will need an IDE and [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed to run the java Playwright tests.

## Checking out the project

1. Sign in to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)
2. On you dashboard, click on `import repository`
3. Fill in the following URL in the `Github Repository URL` field: https://github.com/xebia/cypress-training
4. Click on `Import`.
5. You might get a message that requires you to authorize Codesandbox access to Github. You can confirm this by clicking on the button.
6. If you get the message that you need to fork the repository, please do so.
7. Once the MicroVM has finished loading you will see a window that looks like an IDE. In the left column the files are shown, the middle column contains the opened files at the top and the terminals at the bottom. The right column contains the rendered output. In the case of this training that will be the web browser.

## Setting up your local environment

1. Open the IDE of your choice on the machine where you would like to write your E2E tests.
2. Create a project folder. Your project folder will be the default from where you will run your tests.
3. Inside the project folder, create an empty `pom.xml` file. We will fill this later.
4. Inside the project folder, create the following nested folders and file: `src/main/java/org/tests/ExampleTest.java` with the following code:

   ```java
   package org.tests;
   import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

   public class ExampleTest {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {

            }
        }
    }
   ```

5. Open the `pom.xml` file and specify the following contents:
   ```xml
   <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.10.1</version>
            <!-- References to interface static methods are allowed only at source level 1.8 or above -->
            <configuration>
                <source>1.8</source>
                <target>1.8</target>
            </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
   </project>
   ```

## Downloading the Playwright browser binaries

In your project root folder run the following command:

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -D exec.mainClass="org.tests.ExampleTest"
```

This will download the Playwright browser binaries and it should complete with a `BUILD SUCCESS` message.
