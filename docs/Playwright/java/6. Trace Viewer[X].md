# [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/trace-viewer-intro)

The trace viewer can be used in debugging scenarios, where the environment prevents us from using developer tools such as the Playwright test extension.
The trace viewer is a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests meaning you can go back and forward through each action of your test and visually see what was happening during each action.

## Exercise: [Record a trace](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/trace-viewer-intro#recording-a-trace)

With playwright for Java, a tracing needs to be explicitly enabled in the browser context. 

1. Take a test that you have written before or wite a new test.
2. Enable tracing on the Browsercontext.
3. Write the output of your test as a trace to a file (for example `trace.zip`).
4. Run the test. 
5. Tun the following to open it:

```bash
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="show-trace trace.zip"
```

Alternatively, you can go to https://trace.playwright.dev/ to open your trace there. No data of the trace is sent to a server, it is opened locally inside your browser.

## Exercise: Explore the trace

Once the HTML report is opened, click on a test and in the next screen you'll notice a trace at the bottom. Click on it and navigate through the trace.

What do you notice?
Are you able to see what network requests have been made?
