# Parallelism

By default, Playwright runs one parallel process per test file. We can increase this.

## Exercise: Run a parallel process per test

1. Create a new test file `ParallelTest.java` with two tests.
2. One that clicks on the Nirvana song and checks that the next page contains the text "Nirvana".
3. Another that does the same for a different song, for example "Cypress Hill".
4. Create a new file `testng.xml` in the same folder as your `pom.xml` file with the following contents:
5.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="Parallel Test Suite" parallel="methods">
    <test name="Parallel Test">
        <classes>
            <class name="org.tests.ParallelTest" >
                <methods>
                    <include name="nirvanaNameTest" />
                    <include name="cypressHillNameTest" />
                </methods>
            </class>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
```

Replace `nirvanaNameTest` and `cypressHillNameTest` with the name of your test methods. 5. Edit your `pom.xml` file to contain the following in the build section:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.22.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <suiteXmlFiles>
            <suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile>
        </suiteXmlFiles>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

6. Run these tests by using maven on the command line:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
   How many tests are run?
   What is the output of the tests?
   How long does it take to complete?
7. Edit the `testng.xml` file and change `"classes"` to `"methods"`.
8. Run the tests again from the command line. What do you notice?

## Exercise: More granular control of parallel mode

If we would run all the methods in all the tests in parallel, the tests that change the data will fail. What do you think the reason is?

1. Create a second configuration file `testng2.xml` with the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="End2End Suite" parallel="classes">
    <test name="End2End">
        <classes>
            <class name="org.tests.End2EndTest" >
            </class>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
```

2. Change the contents of your `pom.xml` file as follows:

````xml
<suiteXmlFiles>
    <suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile>
    <suiteXmlFile>testng2.xml</suiteXmlFile>
</suiteXmlFiles>
<properties>
<property>
    <name>suitethreadpoolsize</name>
    <value>2</value>
</property>
</properties>
```
3. Run the tests from the command line. What do you notice? Does it succeed?
4. TIP: Make sure your browser instance is created when running in parallel mode.
