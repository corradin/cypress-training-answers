# Writing end to end tests

In this exercise we will combine everything that we have learned so far.

Recall that you can create tests in different ways:

1. Generating them
   1. With the VS Code plugin (Preferred)
   2. With Codegen
2. Writing them from scratch in a `ts` file

Start with the method you are most comfortable with and is close to your day to day work. When moving to a subsequent exercise try to switch to a different method and see how that works out. 

What are your takeaways?

You can complete this exercise with the following commands:

- [page.goTo](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-by-text)
- [page.getByRole](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-based-on-accessible-attributes)
- [page.getByLabel](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-by-label-text)
- [page.getByText](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-by-text)
- [locator.fill](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#text-input)
- [locator.click](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#mouse-click)
- [locator.press](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#keys-and-shortcuts)
  

## Exercise: Adding a new song

**Let's create our first Song and validate it is shown on the first page.**

- On the Songs page click the `+` button to create a new Song
- Create a song by filling in all the fields, they are all mandatory, click the `CREATE SONG` button and validate that the song is created on the first page.

Once you finished the test, try to run it. Recall that this can be done by clicking on the green arrow left of your test.

## Exercise (Optional): running with the CLI 
If you'd like to use the command line interface read on, otherwise you can skip this exercise.

If you only want to run the test for the file you just created you can do so. Suppose your filename is `e2e.test.ts` you can run this as follows:

```bash
npx playwright test e2e
```

If you want to narrow this down and run it only for 1 project, you can do so with:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium e2e
```

What is the result of the test? Why does it fail?

## Exercise: Start with a clean slate

Tests that rely on the application state, but also update this state during a test run can be tough to deal with. You want your testrun to always start with the same application state, because your tests should be pure. That means given the same input they will produce the same output.
There are multiple ways to clean up this state. 
In this application you can do it by navigating to the following URL, try it:

<http://localhost:8081/reset>

Now try to run the test again. If everything went well, it should pass.

## Exercise: Cleaning up

Now that your first test runs, identify parts where you could refactor, meaning cleaning up. Are all the commands necessary? Can you remove some commands? This is especially the case when you have generated the test with the Playwright extension or Codegen.

## Exercise: Editing an existing song

Let's try to open the edit page for the song we've just added. You may notice something strange here, but we'll come back to that later.

- Click on the `VIEW` button for the song that you added in the previous exercise
- On the song details page, click the `EDIT` button
- Update the details of the song and save your changes
- Make sure you check that the changes you made are reflected in the application on the song list page. 

Run the test. What happens?

## Exercise: Cleaning up

Let's look again at your test and see where you can clean up. Are you happy with the selectors, the steps and the assertions?

Do you have a `div:nth-child` statement in your test? If so, do you need to change it and into what?

Take a look at the [Parent selector](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#parent-selector) for example. How can this help you?

## Exercise: Practicing with more assertions

Take a look at the following commands:

- [locator.toBeFocused](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions#locator-assertions-to-be-focused)
- [locator.getByPlaceholder](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-get-by-placeholder)
- - [locator.getByLabel](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-get-by-label)

Try to create a test that does the following assertions:

- Assert that there is no focus on the search field
- Assert that the correct placeholder text is shown in the search field
- Assert that the field gets focus when clicked
