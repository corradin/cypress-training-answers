# Visual regression

With Playwright, simple visual regression testing can be done. This can be useful to detect changes in the UI automatically.

## Exercise: Set up visual regression

- Create a new testfile `visual-regression.test.ts`
- Create a test that navigates to `localhost:8080`
- Write the following: 
```typescript
    await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot();
```
- Run your test. What is the outcome?
- Run your test again.

## Exercise: Dealing with changing content

Under the hood, Playwright does several things for you when you call the function `toHaveScreenshot`. If the screenshot does not exists, Playwright creates one. If it already exists, a comparison is done with the original (the golden) file. In this exercise we will look what happens when there is dynamic content (for example a marketing banner that changes frequently).

- Add the following code on line `12` of the file `Index.vue`:
```html
<img alt="random-movie-poster" src="https://api.lorem.space/image/movie?w=150&h=220" />
```
- Save the file and look what happens in the browser.
- Refresh a couple of times. You'll see that each time a different image is shown.
- Run your visual regression test again.
  
No matter how often you run it, it will continue to fail, because there is a different visual each time.

- Add a `maxDiffPixelRatio` as an option to the `toHaveScreenshot` with the value `0.45`. You can find how to specify an option on [this page](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots).
  
The test succeeds, but this is not really what we want, because if any other unwanted changes are introduced and fall within the `0.45` ratio, the test will still succeed. We only want to exclude the random banner image from our visual comparison.

- Remove the `maxDiffPixelRatio` option.
- Add a `mask` option. The value of this option is a locator.
- By now you should know how to create a locator. You can use the page.getBy.... to find the banner. Also, the value should be in an array. This means that the mask value will be surrounded by brackets: `mask: [page.getBy...]`.
- Run the test. Why does it fail?
- Run the test from the CLI as follows: `npx playwright test visual --update-snapshots`.
- Run the test again.

From now on it will succeed, since the banner is being excluded from visual comparison.

Note: You can also ignore all visual comparisons when you run your tests with the argument `--ignore-snapshots`.
