# Isolating tests

In the previous exercises the tests needed to be executing in a particular order for them to succeed.

In this exercise, we will make the tests independent of each other so they will always succeed.

## Exercise: Adding the song

Copy the code to add a song at the start of the test that edits the song.

## Exercise: Cleaning up

Clean up the data and the end of both the `create` and `edit song` tests. Don't worry about code duplication, we will deal with that later.

`await page.goto('http://localhost:8081/reset');`

Run the test file. Notice that the tests will succeed and the application is left in the state before adding songs.

We have now made our tests independent of each other. No matter in which order they run, they will always produce the same output. In a next exercise we will see how to reduce the duplicate code.
