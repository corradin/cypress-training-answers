# Sharding

You can distribute your tests on different machines with sharding. This is useful in a CICD scenario where you have multiple machines available. Playwright identifies and divides shards by the argument that you supply. If on machine 1 you specify --shard=1/3, on machine 2 --shard=2/3 and on machine 3 --shard=3/3 Playwright divides and runs the shards separately.

## Exercise: Run a shard

Try to run a shard locally with the following command:

`npx playwright test --shard=1/3`

What is the result?

## Exercise: Sharding based on browsers

We still have the problem that for editing songs different browsers start at the same time, edit or add the same song and remove that song. This causes failures. In this exercise we will solve that.

Browsers are defined in the Playwright config file with the `projects` property.

The easiest way to solve the issue is by running each project sequentially.

`npx playwright test --project=chromium && npx playwright test --project=firefox && npx playwright test --project=webkit`

Although, technically you could argue this is not sharding as we saw in the previous exercise, since the shards cannot be run at the same time.


## Exercise: Optimization

To optimize this run, you can try running it in headless mode and fully parallel per project.
What is the result? Are there other ways to optimize?
