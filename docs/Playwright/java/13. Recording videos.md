# Recording videos

By default Playwright will open the test report in a browser when a test fails. This report is served from the playwright-report directory and contains a trace per test. In this way you should be able to find the cause of the failing test in most cases.
In certain cases it may be helpful to have a recorded video at hand. For example, when you want to look at what went wrong, but you don't have the necessary tools installed to open the trace. This can happen for example if you are on your phone or you want to distribute traces easily to stakeholders without relying on development prerequisites.
In this exercise we will enable the recording of videos.

## Exercise: Start recording videos
In the `playwright.config.ts` enable the option to record videos when a test fails.

Hint: Look [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/videos#record-video).

The videos ares stored as `.webm` files in the `test-results` and `playwright-report` directory. You can change this path by editing the `outputDir` property in the `playwright.config.ts`. Webm files can be played in most browsers without the need of additional plugins. Check [this website](https://www.webmproject.org/users/) for more information. Also, they can be played in VSCode.

If you open the playwright report in the browser, do you notice something different?
Remember that you can open the report by typing the following in the terminal:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
