# Reporting
Once your tests have run, you most likely would want to save the result of these testruns somewhere. With Playwright you can use the built-in reporters, integrate with a few third party reporters such as Allure or even built your own custom reporters using the [Reporter API](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter).

## Exercise: Configure a built-in reporter
You can specify the type of reporter in the Playwright config file (`playwright.config.ts`).
Try replacing the HTML reporter by the [List reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter), run your test and notice how the output is different.

You are only able to see the HTML reporter output if your tests fails with the command `npx playwright test`.

## Exercise: Multiple reporters 

You can also have more than 1 reporter. Try to combine the line reporter with the HTML reporter. More information can be found [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#multiple-reporters).
