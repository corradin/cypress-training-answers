# [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/trace-viewer-intro)

The trace viewer can be used in debugging scenarios, where the environment prevents us from using developer tools such as the Playwright test extension.
The trace viewer is a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests meaning you can go back and forward through each action of your test and visually see what was happening during each action.

## Exercise: [Record a trace](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/trace-viewer-intro#recording-a-trace)

With playwright for Java, a tracing needs to be explicitly enabled in the browser context. When you enable it, output to trace.zip and you should be able to view it with the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="show-trace trace.zip"
```

## Exercise: Explore the trace

Once the HTML report is opened, click on a test and in the next screen you'll notice a trace at the bottom. Click on it and navigate through the trace.

What do you notice?
Are you able to see what network requests have been made?
