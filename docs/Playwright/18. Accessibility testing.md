# Accessibility testing

Accessibility testing is often an afterthought, if done at all. There are an increasingly number of initiatives to increase the accessibility of your web app. In this exercise we will look at one of those initiatives: [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)

Note: As is described [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/accessibility-testing) creating automated tests to tackle accessibility issues is only part of the solution. Some issues can only be found by manual testing. Read the disclaimer on the provided link to see the recommendations from the Playwright team.

## Exercise: Install the Playwright axe library

- In the terminal at the root of your client folder, type:
  
  `npm i -D @axe-core/playwright`


## Exercise: Create an accessibility test

You can use [this reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/accessibility-testing#scanning-an-entire-page) throughout the exercise.

- Create a new test file, for example `axe.test.ts`
- Import `AxeBuilder` from the `@axe-core/playwright` library
- Navigate to the home page and run the `analyze()` function of the `AxeBuilder`
- Write an expect similar to the one in the reference link mentioned at the start of this exercise

What happens when you run the test?

## Exercise: Fine tuning the accessibility test

There are a lot of accessibility violations reported. Let's see if we can adhere to a specific standard. 

Let's say the requirement of our web app is to be [WCAG 2 Level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) compliant.

- Change your test to only run the analysis for the requirement.
- Run your test

What is the outcome? How many violations do you see?

## Bonus Exercise: Minimize accessibility violations

- Try to solve the accessibility issues. How close to zero can you get?
