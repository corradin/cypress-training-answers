# Setup and teardown

If you want to run a couple of tests before or after all your other tests you can do so easily in the configuration file.
This scenario can be useful when you need to prepare a certain setup and you would like to clean it up at the end.

## Exercise: Create the setup code
- Create a new test file `setup.test.ts`
- Write a test that navigates to a URL of your choosing
- Check if the test works

## Exercise: Configure the setup code to run before all other tests
- In the `playwright.config.ts` add a new project
- Give it a name
- Add a testMatch property to it to only match the `setup.test.ts` file that you created in the previous exercise
- In the other project add a `dependencies` property
- Specify the name of the project you choose earlier in this exercise

You can find more information on how to configure dependencies correctly on [THIS LINK](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-dependencies)

If you run your tests, what do you see? When is the setup test run?

## Exercise: Teardown

Similar to the previous exercise, create a test `teardown.test.ts` that navigates to `http://localhost:8081/reset`. Configure Playwright in such a way that this test runs after all other tests have finished running.
