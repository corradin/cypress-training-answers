# Your first test

## Exercise: Run in headed mode

Playwright generates a sample test in the `tests` folder.
If you would run Playwright with `npx playwright test`, you will not see that much happen.
Playwright also generates a `playwright.config.ts` file.
Open this file and disable headless mode. To learn how to do so, check [this link](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

## Exercise: Slowing down
Even if you are running in headed mode, it still is hard to follow what is going on. You could add a slowdown timer that adds an amount of milliseconds between all actions.

Again, you can do this in the configuration file. Check out [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#more-browser-and-context-options) how.

## Exercise: Catching up
Take some time and try to understand what the test is doing. You can also change the test, run it and see how your chances affect the outcome.

How do these tests differ from the tests that you are usually creating?
