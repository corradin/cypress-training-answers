# Parallelism

By default, Playwright runs one parallel process per test file. We can increase this.

## Exercise: Run a parallel process per test

- Create a new test file `parallel.test.ts` with two tests.
- One that clicks on the Nirvana song and checks that the next page contains the text "Nirvana".
- Another that does the same for a different song, for example "Cypress Hill".
- Check your Playwright config file. If `fullyParallel` is set to `true`, set it to `false`.
- Run these tests by using the CLI: `npx playwright test parallel`.
- Set `fullyParallel` to `true`.
- Run the tests again. What do you notice?

## Exercise: More granular control of parallel mode

If we would run all the tests now with `npx playwright test`, the tests that change the data will fail. What do you think the reason is?

- Set `fullyParallel` to `false`
- In the `parallel.test.ts` file add a configuration to run only in parallel for this file. You can check [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel#parallelize-tests-in-a-single-file) how to do this.
