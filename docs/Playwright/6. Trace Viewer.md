# [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro)

The trace viewer can be used in debugging scenarios, where the environment prevents us from using developer tools such as the Playwright test extension.
The trace viewer is a GUI tool that lets you explore recorded Playwright traces of your tests meaning you can go back and forward through each action of your test and visually see what was happening during each action.


## Exercise: [Record a trace](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro#recording-a-trace)

You can do this in the Playwright config file. Try recording a trace.
Open the trace by opening your report. Recall that this can be done with the command: 

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Exercise: Explore the trace
Once the HTML report is opened, click on a test and in the next screen you'll notice a trace at the bottom. Click on it and navigate through the trace.

What do you notice? 
Are you able to see what network requests have been made?
