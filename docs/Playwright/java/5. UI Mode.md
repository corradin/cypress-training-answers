# [UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode)

The UI Mode can be used in debugging scenarios, where the environment prevents us from using developer tools such as the Playwright test extension.
UI Mode is a tool that lets you explore, run and debug Playwright tests. It contains traces, screen recordings and source code. It is an excellent alternative if you prefer to debug your tests in a more visual environment.
