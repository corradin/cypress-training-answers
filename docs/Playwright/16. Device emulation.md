# Device emulation

With playwright you can emulate different devices. There is a full list available [HERE](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-core/src/server/deviceDescriptorsSource.json).


## Exercise: Emulate a device
Device emulation can be done through the Playwright config file in the projects property.

- Add a new project for a device of your choice. You can use [this page](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation#devices) together with the link provided at the start of this document as a reference.
- Run your tests for the newly defined project. Remember you can use the `--project=` syntax

What do you notice when running the tests?
