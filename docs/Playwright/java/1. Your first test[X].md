# Your first test

## Exercise: The bare minimum

1. Open the `ExampleTest.java` file from the previous exercise and change the body of the main method it to the following:

```java
try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
            Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch();
            Page page = browser.newPage();
            page.navigate("http://playwright.dev");
        }
```

2. In your project root folder run the following command:

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -D exec.mainClass="org.tests.ExampleTest"
```

If everything goes well, you will see a `BUILD SUCCESS` message.

## Exercise: Run in headed mode

As you saw in the previous exercise, running a default Playwright test will not show you that much. This is because Playwright by default runs in headless mode.
Change the file so you it runs in headed mode.
To learn how to do so, check [this link](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-option-headless) and [this link](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/running-tests#introduction).

## Exercise: Slowing down

Even if you are running in headed mode, it still is hard to follow what is going on. You could add a slowdown timer that adds an amount of milliseconds between all actions.

You can do this with `BrowserType.LaunchOptions()` as can be read [HERE](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-connect-over-cdp-option-slow-mo). 

For example:

```java
BrowserType.LaunchOptions().setSlowMo(2000)
```

## Exercise: Catching up

Take some time and try to understand what the test is doing. You can also change the test, run it and see how your chances affect the outcome.

How do these tests differ from the tests that you are usually creating?
