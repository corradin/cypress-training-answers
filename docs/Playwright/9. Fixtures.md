# Fixtures

In this exercise we are going to deduplicate the code from the previous exercise.

## Exercise: Moving duplicate code to a function

Define the following function at the top of your test file:

```typescript
const createSong = async (page: Page) => {}
```
Add the `Page` import to the others at the start of the file so it look like the following:

```typescript
import { test, expect, Page } from '@playwright/test';
```

Move the duplicated code that creates the song to the body of this function and call the function as follows:

```typescript
await createSong(page);
```

Run the tests.

## Exercise: Moving to a fixture

It already looks a lot cleaner, but we can do better. Suppose we have multiple test files that need to create songs. In that case, this solution will not suffice, because it only works for this file.

In this exercise we will create a `createSong` fixture. You can read more about creating fixtures [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#creating-a-fixture). This will also include more advanced uses of fixture that we will not cover here.

Create a new file in your `tests` folder called `fixtures.ts`.

Add the following imports to the file:

```typescript
import { expect, Page } from '@playwright/test';
```
Move the `createSong` function to this file and prepend it with the `export` keyword.

```typescript
    export const createSong = async (page: Page) => {...}
```

In your testfile import the `createSong` function:

```typescript
import { createSong } from './fixtures';
```

## Exercise: A fixture for cleaning up

Similar to the previous exercise, try to make a fixture for the cleanup action, which is:

```typescript
await page.goto('http://localhost:8081/reset');
```
