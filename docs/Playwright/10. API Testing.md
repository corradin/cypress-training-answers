# API Testing

In this exercise we will use Playwright to make API requests. This can be useful in scenarios where you have no API tests in place yet or you want to specifically test your frontend related APIs and are already using Playwright.

## Exercise: Create a test file

Create a new testfile, for example `api.test.ts` and define a test.

## Exercise: Make a request

Make a GET request to `localhost:8081/song` and expect a status code of `200 (OK)` is returned.

More on how you can do this can be found [HERE](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-api-testing#writing-tests).

## Exercise: Match the returned response

Now expand your test by asserting that the First song is in the list of the returned songs:

```json
{
    'id': 1,
    'title': 'Nevermind',
    'artist': 'Nirvana',
    'genre': 'Alternative Rock',
    'album': 'Nevermind',
    'albumImageUrl': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/d0/cc/62/dj.nanioukp.jpg/268x0w.jpg',
    'youtubeId': 'm-ofL_3EZyE',
    'lyrics': '',
    'tab': '',
    'createdAt': '2018-02-13T12:56:24.432Z',
    'updatedAt': '2018-02-13T12:56:24.432Z',
  };
```

You can use the `toContainEqual` matcher for this.

## Exercise (bonus)
Try to strongly type this, so create a Song `type` and make the expected object of type `Song`.

What benefit does this have over the previously defined code?
